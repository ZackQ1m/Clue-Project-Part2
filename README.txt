Project: Clue Paths 2 (LO12 - Pair)



What We Changed and Why:
We adjusted two test methods to match the official Clue rules.

In testTargetsMaxRoll, we removed the start cell (0,0) from valid targets since players cannot stay in or revisit the same cell.

In testTargetsWithRoom, we updated targets so movement stops immediately upon entering a room.
